32/34 Key Keyboard, integrated rp2040

# Frigate V1 is not working. V2 is the final version of this keyboard.
Frigate V2 final are not the same as the Early adopter boards. This one has all of the silscreens, and it is also wired to support i2c and SPI versions of the cirque.
The early adopters version only supports SPI.
